## Usage

When you open the webpage, you'll see at the left the options for the screensaver. Here you can change:
- The transition time;
- The time between each image/video change;
- The custom CSS filter that'll be applied over the image/video
- If you want to pick a folder or single files;
- If you want to save your current selection inside the browser so that you won't need to choose the images/videos again the next time you'll use custom-screensaver
- If you wanto to hide the cursor while an image/video is being displayed
- If the videos should be played until the end (even if this means going over the time between each image/video change)

At the right, you'll see the button to load images/videos. After you've selected some of them, click on the `Start now` button. The window will be displayed in fullscreen mode, and you'll see all of your images.
